## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest backend/app/tests/test_dmarc_parser.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `backend/app/tests/`
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Name test functions with `test_` prefix
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

Example:

```python
def test_dmarc_parser_handles_valid_xml():
    """Test that the parser correctly processes valid DMARC XML"""
    parser = DMARCParser()
    result = parser.parse_xml(valid_xml_content)
    assert result is not None
    assert result['domain'] == 'example.com'
```

### Test Coverage Goals

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Critical security features should have 100% coverage
- All new features must include tests

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line length**: Maximum 100 characters (not 79)
- **Imports**: Organize as stdlib, third-party, local
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Type hints**: Use type hints for function signatures

Example:

```python
from typing import Optional, List
from datetime import datetime

def process_dmarc_report(
    domain: str, 
    report_xml: str, 
    timestamp: Optional[datetime] = None
) -> List[dict]:
    """
    Process a DMARC aggregate report.
    
    Args:
        domain: The domain name being reported on
        report_xml: Raw XML content of the DMARC report
        timestamp: Optional timestamp for the report
        
    Returns:
        List of processed report records
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the XML is malformed
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Code Formatting

We use automated code formatters:

```bash
# Format code with black
black backend/app/

# Sort imports with isort
isort backend/app/

# Type checking with mypy (coming soon)
mypy backend/app/
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use proper Markdown formatting

## Commit Messages

Follow the Conventional Commits specification:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- `security`: Security improvements or fixes

### Examples

```
feat(parser): add support for forensic DMARC reports

Added parsing logic for DMARC forensic (failure) reports (RUF).
This allows users to see detailed information about individual
email authentication failures.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(imap): handle connection timeout gracefully

The IMAP client now properly handles timeout exceptions and
retries with exponential backoff. This prevents the application
from crashing when the mail server is temporarily unavailable.

Fixes #456
```

```
security(api): add authentication to admin endpoints

Added authentication checks to /api/v1/admin/* endpoints to
prevent unauthorized access.

BREAKING CHANGE: Admin endpoints now require authentication token
```

```

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (linting, tests, security scans)
2. **At least one maintainer review** is required
3. **Address review comments** promptly and professionally
4. **Keep the PR focused** - one feature/fix per PR
5. **Be patient** - maintainers review PRs as time allows

### After Approval

Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR. The merge will trigger:

- Automated deployment (if applicable)
- Documentation updates
- Release notes generation

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. Email the maintainers (see SECURITY.md for contact info)
2. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
3. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

### Security Best Practices

When contributing code that touches security-sensitive areas:

- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- **Validate all inputs** from users or external systems
- **Use parameterized queries** (our ORM does this automatically)
- **Follow principle of least privilege**
- **Add security tests** for authentication/authorization changes
- **Document security implications** in your PR

### Security Checklist for PRs

If your PR involves any of these, extra scrutiny is required:

- [ ] Authentication or authorization
- [ ] Data validation or sanitization
- [ ] Database queries
- [ ] File uploads or downloads
- [ ] External API calls
- [ ] Cryptography or password handling
- [ ] Configuration or environment variables

## Working with AI Assistants (Agentic Coding)

DMARQ is designed to be "agentic coding friendly" - meaning it works well with AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and similar tools.

### Tips for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Clear Context**: Ensure your AI assistant has context about DMARQ's architecture
2. **Security First**: Always review AI-generated code for security implications
3. **Test Coverage**: AI-generated code still needs tests
4. **Code Review**: Human review is essential for AI-generated contributions
5. **Documentation**: Update docs even for AI-assisted changes

### Prompts that Work Well

When using AI assistants, these patterns work well:

```
"Add a new API endpoint to [do something], following DMARQ's existing patterns in the api/ directory"

"Write tests for [functionality] using the existing test structure in tests/"

"Refactor [module] to improve [aspect] while maintaining backward compatibility"

"Add input validation for [endpoint] following DMARQ's security guidelines"
```
